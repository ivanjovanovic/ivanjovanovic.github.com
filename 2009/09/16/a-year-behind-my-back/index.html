  <h1 class="article-title">A Year Behind My Back</h1>
  <div class="article-content"><p>The year is behind me since I wrote last post. A lot, mostly good, has
happened.</p>

<p>First and most important I have finished my studies. Now I can proudly say that I&#8217;m an Electrical Engineer in the field of Automation and Control Engineering. But wait, how does Senior Web Developer position relates to that? Let that be a topic for further evaluation :) Let just say that in one moment I had to decide what interests me more.</p>

<p>Somewhere at the beginning of February, after almost year and a half,
our cooperation with Tilllate ended. Thanks to the Maarten, Leo, Silvan,
Cyprian, Jia-yong Ou, Michael, Thilo and others for being friendly,
positive and smart to create great surrounding to work in. I have raised
my skill to much higher level and learned a lot about programming in
high-traffic, heavy-loaded environment and gained much wider view on
software development than I had before. I&#8217;d like to specially thank to
Tilllate Chief Software Engineer Maarten Manders for having confidence
that I will do proper job with some crucial parts of Tilllate, I hope I
succeeded.</p>

<p>During the March I have started looking for a new job, preferably in Switzerland. After evaluation of open positions in the market I have applied for a position of frontend engineer in <a title="Local.ch" href="http://www.local.ch">local.ch</a>. In May I went to Zurich on the interview and until the beginning of the June I was offered a job. I accepted the offer and there was just one little thing standing between me and Zurich, the procedure of getting working permission for the non-EU citizen. Hard times for me :) To cut the story (since writing this post took some time and things happened meanwhile) I got my working permission after several months. Now I&#8217;m waiting for Swiss entrance visa and until the end of October I should start on my new job in Zurich. Currently I&#8217;m looking for a temporary flat in Zurich where I could reside for couple months before I find real place to live and bring my wife to Zurich too.</p>

<p>As it is in real life, some stories are at the beginning, and some are at the end. While writing this post, I&#8217;m spending last days in <a title="youngculture" href="http://www.youngculture.com">youngculture</a>. It was great experience and pleasure, before all, for me to work with some of the most advanced developers in Belgrade in very high-quality working environment. I met friends for the whole life here and my two years in Belgrade will stay clearly positive experience. However, <a href="http://www.youngculture.com">youngculture</a> headquarters is based in Zurich, and people that I worked with regularly travel to Switzerland, so I presume I won&#8217;t miss them too much :) I&#8217;m ready for beer or two whenever you call!!!!</p>

<p>The year has passed so fast that I almost did not notice it. Just heard &quot;whuush&quot; sound somewhere around birthday. I had no time to devote to the things I like as blogging and out-of-work internet existence, but I hope that next year will change that. I planned to reorganize this domain and blog so I could efficiently present what I&#8217;m working on and things I like. I hope as well that starting new job will give me the chance to reconsider some priorities in life and bring some fresh air as well.</p>
