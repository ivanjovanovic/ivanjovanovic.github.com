I helped building some of the biggest Swiss websites like <a href="http://tilllate.ch">tilllate.com</a> (one of the biggest European social networks in the pre-Facebook era) and <a href="https://local.ch">local.ch</a>, one of the most visited Swiss websites.

From mid 2013 to the end of 2016 I worked at Microsoft R&D center in Zurich, leading a front-end team responsible for building Microsoft Social Engagement, complex web product for social data acquisition, analytics and cross-channel engagement, part of [Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/crm-social.aspx) offer. Currently, I am providing services in the domain of web software engineering as an independent contractor.

Through years I worked in number of roles and gathered experiences from almost every aspect of the software development process, from quality assurance to people and project management. I acquired deep understanding of:

* _Object-oriented, functional programming paradigms and advanced programming concepts._
* _Design and implementation of client and backend architectures._
* _Team leadership, organisation and project delivery based on agile principles._
* _Focus on analysis and design of business goals through communication with product management_
* _Process of continuous delivery, deployment and production operations of a web product._
* _Quality assurance process organisation and test automation_
* _People management based on growth mindset and aspiration towards personal growth and excellence._
* _Hiring, team expansion and product growth as member of a product lead group._
* _Working in international, distributed remote setup across continents._

Through my work I focused my expertise on the application side of the projects where I regularly contributed as a full-stack web developer. I have used mostly following technologies:

* _Javascript/TypeScript, React, jQuery, Backbone, HTML, CSS (with pre-processors), Grunt/Webpack and number of related client-side libraries and concepts_
* _Java (Spring, Jetty, Maven, GWT), Ruby, PHP_
* _Puppet, Docker, Azure_

As a curious engineer, I am committed to continuous improvement of my technical and non-technical skills needed for best possible contribution in the process of web product delivery.
