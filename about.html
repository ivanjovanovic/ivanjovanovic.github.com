          <h1>Ivan Jovanovic</h1>

          <p><img class="personal-photo" src="./images/ivanjovanovic.png" />Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan, professional web software engineer with 15 years of experience in building web products of high load, scale and complexity using various technologies.</p>
<p>I helped building some of the biggest Swiss websites like <a href="http://tilllate.ch">tilllate.com</a> (one of the biggest European social networks in the pre-Facebook era) and <a href="https://local.ch">local.ch</a>, one of the most visited Swiss websites.</p>
<p>From mid 2013 to the end of 2016 I worked at Microsoft R&amp;D center in Zurich, leading a front-end team responsible for building Microsoft Social Engagement, complex web product for social data acquisition, analytics and cross-channel engagement, part of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics/crm-social.aspx">Microsoft Dynamic 365</a> offer. Currently, I am providing services in the domain of web software engineering as an independent contractor.</p>
<p>Through years I worked in number of roles and gathered experiences from almost every aspect of the software development process, from quality assurance to people and project management. I acquired deep understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Object-oriented, functional programming paradigms and advanced programming concepts.</em></li>
<li><em>Design and implementation of client and backend architectures.</em></li>
<li><em>Team leadership, organisation and project delivery based on agile principles.</em></li>
<li><em>Focus on analysis and design of business goals through communication with product management</em></li>
<li><em>Process of continuous delivery, deployment and production operations of a web product.</em></li>
<li><em>Quality assurance process organisation and test automation</em></li>
<li><em>People management based on growth mindset and aspiration towards personal growth and excellence.</em></li>
<li><em>Hiring, team expansion and product growth as member of a product lead group.</em></li>
<li><em>Working in international, distributed remote setup across continents.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Through my work I focused my expertise on the application side of the projects where I regularly contributed as a full-stack web developer. I have used mostly following technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Javascript/TypeScript, React, jQuery, Backbone, HTML, CSS (with pre-processors), Grunt/Webpack and number of related client-side libraries and concepts</em></li>
<li><em>Java (Spring, Jetty, Maven, GWT), Ruby, PHP</em></li>
<li><em>Puppet, Docker, Azure</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As a curious engineer, I am committed to continuous improvement of my technical and non-technical skills needed for best possible contribution in the process of web product delivery.</p>
