These days I was asked by my relative about how to start with PHP.Â Although he is experienced programmer and already used PHP long time before, somewhere when PHP 4 was actual he liked to know my opinion on it since I'm in it for a long time already.
-This is not "Hello World" approach, it is rather "Hello mind" view on this topic.
- PHP is build around problems people had implementing web applications, so learn concepts of the web. Understand share nothing architecture and why is it important. Don't be upset with the ugliness of the tool, it is damn useful, and it was never ment to be pretty probably.
- PHP is not 360 solution for the web applications, neither Zend Framework is. It is rather place where Java mindset tries to meet PHP.
He asked me about good book on PHP. I didn't know what to say, I hardly ever had PHP book, I mean, it is all around you, PHP has I believe the most to offer from resources o nthe web. You have to do some cherry picking but at the end it is all free, so if you don't like it, improve it.
