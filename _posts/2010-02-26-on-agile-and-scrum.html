Last months we have put lot of effort within local.ch to implement Scrum as way of our internal organization. I'll try to explain in this post my personal feeling about it.

Lets first define some rough measurements of the quality of development process and the way programmers ad to it. I like to take end product quality and price of the product as best quality abstractions since it is what counts at the end. If we take for example overdue of project shipping, cost of project implementation and work needed after project is shipped (a.k.a hunting bugs on live servers), then I can tell that all of the processes I participated in during my programming time were more or less fails. The more process was far from common sense of the programmers involved bigger fail it was. I'd like to paraphrase Jeff Sutherland from last Scrum evening in Zurich "First sh** you need to throw out of your development process is timesheet". He didn't mention the <strong>s</strong> word, but he mentioned time sheets several times :) Intentionally mentioning timesheets since one common pattern between within all the approaches that were failing for me in the past was the need of management to highly control what developers do, and from the other side restrict the space for reaction to a change. This is nothing new and it is well described in lot of resources around.

- Becoming popular around the world
- Brings new dynamics but most important is that it brings new way of looking at development.
- Have to be implemented differently in every organization

Homogenizes organizations.Gives better insight in process to every developer
- applying it is very hard since it seems to be less restrictive but requires more discipline and focus
Motivates personally
