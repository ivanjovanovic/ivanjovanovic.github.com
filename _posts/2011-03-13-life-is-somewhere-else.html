Some weeks earlier I spontaneously got involved in something that turned out to be really great and eye opening experience. It took a while to write this post, but I think it is interesting to share it.
I was planning my weekend, and wanted to see what <a title="Joël Bez - website" href="http://www.lejoe.com/">Joel</a> was up to when he told me that he had plan to go hacking over weekend in order to help guys that run <a href="http://eq.org.nz/">http://eq.org.nz/</a> to polish some things on their website. Hacking, helping, sounded like a good idea to me, so I joined the weekend fun without knowing much details. Later I got to know that this site is used to organize people in Christchurch after latest devastating earthquakes.

Organization was pretty simple. Saturday morning we go to <a href="http://yellow.local.ch/en/d/Zuerich/8002/Google-Switzerland-GmbH-mQdkOw5SinvyKEqvpiNelw?what=google&amp;where=zurich">Google Zürich offices</a>, get instructions what they need on the field and do as much as we can in one day. It was only 4 of us: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/noirins">Noirin</a> as host at Google, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mjollnir">Penny</a>, <a href="http://www.lejoe.com/">Joel</a> and I. It was quite intensive since we had to set-up dev environment and get into the matter pretty fast if we wanted to get anything done that day.  The <a href="http://eq.org.nz/">http://eq.org.nz/</a> website is based on <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> geospatial visualization platform which is based on Kohana PHP framework. I was surprised how easy was to get into the code of the platform, although far from perfect, it is one of better organized PHP open source codes around. Overall I was impressed how much small, highly focused, high skilled team can achieve in a day without even deep understanding of the overall context.

Anyways, it is not only that which amazed me. From the other side, the whole thing made me think a bit above some of mine feelings towards technologies, internet before all, and how they affect our lives. As individual that remembers the days before massive adoption of internet I feel that part of our intrinsic humanity is drifting out all of us by constantly interfacing displays and machines instead of real people. I feel that life is getting sucked out of us and placed in the interwebs. It is placed in more or less structured, searchable and more or less massively (ab)usable form. By observing how others think I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one feeling this way. But looking around the topic of this kind of activism online gave me feeling that whole new way of practicing humanity is on the rise. Even in a much broader way, that were not that easily achievable before are now quite reasonable and expectable.

Curious as always, I looked around what is going on with community around Ushahidi and found some interesting movements, groups and ideas. Ushahidi platform is in general used around the world for mapping various things beside emergent situations, usually by NGOs and motivated groups. And as I see the community around it is growing and structuring pretty fast. It was incredible to see how fast reactions were on the Libya crisis and Japan earthquake. On the other side there is lot of creative energy on this field through RHOK which systematically organize engineers around world to find new ways of handling critical situations with the help of technology enabled communities. Next RHOK days are sometimes in early June and will give my best to participate.
