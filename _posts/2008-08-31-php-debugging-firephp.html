I remember when I started using FireBug it was great help in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript development and debugging.

I've just found out <strong>FirePHP</strong>, FireBug plugin that enables the developer to send log messages from PHP code to FireBug console. Quite helpfull I can say :) It consists of Firefox extension (mentioned FireBug plugin) and small PHP logger that you actually use in your code to communicate with the FireBug console. Logger comes in procedural and object-oriented fashion so if you are striving towards exceptional performance of your PHP app, or just still old-school PHP4 (R.I.P.), then man you have your choice :) Otherwise use OO PHP5 logger class. I've manage to set the demo, that goes within the PHP library, in a couple of minutes and I'm looking forward for using it in the future.

Thanks guys for great work.

Another cool thing that comes with the FirePHP is its integration posibilities with CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Drupal, ExpressionEngine, Kohana, PRADO, Symfony, TYPO3, <strong>Zend Framework.</strong> So there is some for anyone.
