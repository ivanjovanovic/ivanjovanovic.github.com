- management that doesn't get agile is not too much excited about small gradual changes

- they usually see progress only through big change that is obvious to the user. When you think this way, then you end up in planning releases for months upfront and even if you do Scrum or similar, it looks more like a waterfall release process

- main cause of this is lack of clear vision of core competence of the product, and therefore jumping around fro topic to topic and trying to achieve something out of it. Therefore team implements numerous features that never get released since they never get finished to the state which is releasable, or when they are released, they get forgotten immediately since new feature to be implemented is waiting in the queue.
