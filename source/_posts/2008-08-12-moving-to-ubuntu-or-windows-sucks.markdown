It was long time ago I started to feel constraints of Windows as web development environment. So, very logical step was to move to something more developer friendly than user (read dummy) friendly. After testing Ubuntu with VMware player I decided to go step further and use <a title="WUBI (Ubuntu Installer for Windows)" href="http://wubi-installer.org/">WUBI (Windows Ubuntu installer)</a> to intall Ubuntu as Windows application in a folder that will act as separate filesystem for my linux installation.

Yes, I know it is not perfect solution, but since I'm running it on Toshiba laptop I was worried about drivers and related staffÂ  and didn't want to stay even without the Vista crap (TM).
After all installation was smooth and harmless and it seems that everything works as expected for now. Setting the development environment is the next challenge I'll take. Apache, MySQL, SVN ... here I come :)
