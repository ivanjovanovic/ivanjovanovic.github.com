After great weekend I spent during [RHoK #3 in Basel](http://www.rhok.org/event/basel)
I decided to join the RHoK Switzerland organization and help making next event
in Zürich even more awesome.

Last Tuesday, I had a pleasure to present next [Random Hacks of
Kindness](http://www.rhok.org) event in front of the Zürich
[Webtuesday](http://webtuesday.ch/) community and here I wanted to share
slides from that presentation with a bit of context.

## TL;DR for the impatient
RHoK #4 is going to happen in Zürich on 3rd and 4th
of December 2011. You should join because it is never bad time to invest
your time and expertise for the good cause. You can join by registering
through [Eventbrite form](http://www.rhok.org/event/zurich-switzerland)
on the official event page. You can see more details about the RHoK
community on the [official web site](http://www.rhok.org). For following

## So, what makes RHoK different
Comparing to other hackaton based activities that I noticed, RHoK stands
out with the systematic orientation towards permanent and sustainable
impact over longer future. It is obvious to see that for a weekend of
hacking big problems can't be solved. Knowing that RHoK tends to attack
this problem particularly by building strong relation to organizations
and individuals that are closest to the problems being solved. In Basel, for example,
we had on site representatives from [Caritas Switzerland](http://www.caritas.ch) and
[Humanity Road](http://www.humanityroad.org/). This way, from one side
RHoK helps Subject Matter Experts (as we call them) be strong problem
owners and drivers for the change, and from the other side RHoK brings
needed knowledge to attack these problems with high quality.

Of course, you can bring your own idea to the event and try to motivate
others to join you bringing it to life or you can just hack on it
yourself. Only constrait is that at the end of the weekend you'll have
to present what you did and explaing why it matters to be solved.

## RHoK is a competition event
The weekend event itself is a competition. At the end of the weekend,
you will, with your team, present what you came up with. Our sponsors
provide prizes for the winners. So if you are competitive even more
reasons to come.

## Bringing needed knowledge to the problem
The way hackatons usually happen is around focused communities. For
example, Ruby/RoR community meets once a month and hacks on things they
are interested in, usually not oriented towards the humanity related
problems. Although this is great, this approach lacks some pieces in
order to sustainably solve big real world problems. RHoK as a concept
tries to bring ALL the knowledge needed not only the technical one. That
is why we try to motivate **product owners, designers, user interaction
experts, thinkers or activists** to participate in
various parts of the process as a part of the team attacking particular
problem. This way we think we can make teams last longer than a weekend
and drive the solution to the state when it is being used in production.

## RHoK #4 Zürich, 3rd and 4th of December 2011

What we provide is a venue, infrastructure, food and refreshements. At
the beginning of the event we'll get an overview of the problems that we
might attack during the weekend. All the problems are placed on the
official [RHoK website](http://www.rhok.org/problems) in the problems section.
For some of the problems we'll have on-site representatives, for some of
them you might want to pair up with a team from another [RHoK event from
the list](http://www.rhok.org/events) or you might bring your own
problem and attack it alone or with other participants that decide to
join you.
