  <h1 class="article-title">Why (I Think) Khan Academy Really Matters.</h1>
  <div class="article-content"><p>Today I made <a title="Serbian translation of Khan Academy video" href="http://www.universalsubtitles.org/en/videos/2QEdZnl4jZvK/sr/115753/">first translation to Serbian on Khan Academy</a> and this post is about why I loved doing it and why I think it really matters.</p>

<p>If you havent heard of <a title="Khan Academy" href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> yet you should immediately get out that rock you are hiding under. No joke, Khan Academy is a big thing. Watch <a title="Salman Khan TED talk" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html">this TED talk</a> to see how amazing is what Salman Khan is doing. I was really happy when I saw that <a href="http://ejohn.org/">John Resig of jQuery fame</a> has <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/next-steps-in-2011/">joined their crew</a> to help bringing this extraordinary mission to the next level. It is really extraordinary, especially for the times of today when everything is in profits and money. But it doesn&#8217;t matter only because of that.</p>

<p>I come from Serbia, country which is in kind of development. Last 20 years where not that good for us. Degradation of every part of society to the critical level happened during that time. People mostly without jobs, hope and will to go forward despite the fact that time passes by them fast. Yes, time passes by and developed world is changing even faster every day. And if you stand still for 20 years, you can imagine how far world goes in front of you. It goes so far that you, from your own point of view don&#8217;t understand any more all that modern development and trends.</p>

<p>So the big question for countries like Serbia is how do they catch up with the modern world. How do you learn things you have to know when you don&#8217;t have access to good and innovative education, have no great people to lead the country because they are all spread around the world. Well, there are options. And improving education of people is in the core of all of them. In this context Khan Academy really matters. Not as final solution but more as announcement of future where education is going to be much less institutionalized and much easier spread across the globe, especially in the countries which need this the most.</p>

<p>Internet has evolved to a point where it is becoming a platform for spreading something more than Facebook and Farmville. Recently I watched <a title="Chris Anderson on TED.com" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/chris_anderson_how_web_video_powers_global_innovation.html">TED talk of Chris Anderson</a> on how web video powers global innovation and I could not agree more. And Khan Academy proves this in practice on a high scale and is able to motivate thousands to join the train of global education improvement and to bring it to the higher level. This might lead to looking at the education in whole lot different ways than before and using peoples potential most efficiently to solve problems of underdeveloped communities. It brings some hope at least.

Currently I live in Switzerland, country blessed by the best standard in the world and really great performance in every aspect, from administration to education. One thing I see here is that people are not aware enough how others in the world live and when aware it is on the level of general empathy and not on the level of doing something with it. Paradoxically, countries like this can give the most to the world, not only by sharing money but experiences and knowledge about their success as well. Internet in this case might be a great leverage for small and great ones to influence world wide.</p>

<p>Considering all of this, I though I could be one among this army of good people to help on this idea. I&#8217;ll try to contribute on this topic as much as I can in my spare time and motivate others to do the same. Translating as much videos to Serbian would be one of primary goals and promoting the idea as well.</p>
